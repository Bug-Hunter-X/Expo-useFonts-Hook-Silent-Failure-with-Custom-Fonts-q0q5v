This bug occurs when using the Expo `useFonts` hook with a custom font that has unusual characters or unexpected file formatting.  The hook might fail silently, not throwing an error but simply not loading the font, leaving the app with the default system font. This is particularly problematic because it doesn't provide any clear error messages.  The issue is exacerbated when the font file itself is slightly corrupted or has metadata inconsistencies. This often results in the app building successfully but not rendering the custom fonts in the UI.
